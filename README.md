1. First, an array of objects called "generations" is defined. Each object in the array represents a Pokemon generation and contains two properties: "limit" and "offset". These properties are used to determine the number of Pokemon to retrieve and the starting point in the API's data for each generation.

2. Next, a constant called "endpoint" is defined, which stores the URL of the PokeAPI.

3. An async function called "fetchGenerations" is defined. This function does the following:

a. It creates an array of URLs to fetch data from each generation of Pokemon by using the map() method on the "generations" array. For each object in the "generations" array, the function extracts the "limit" and "offset" properties and concatenates them to the "endpoint" URL to create a complete URL for fetching data for that generation.

b. The function then uses the Promise.all() method to fetch data from all the URLs in the "urls" array simultaneously. This method returns an array of all the responses.

c. After receiving all the responses, the function uses the Promise.all() method again to extract the JSON data from each response.

d. Finally, the function logs the data to the console.

4. The "fetchGenerations" function is called at the end of the code, which initiates the process of fetching data from the PokeAPI.
